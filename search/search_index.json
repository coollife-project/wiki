The methodology is structured to utilize open-source data sets for evaluating EU-wide cooling demand trends, starting with a bottom-up estimation based on national building stock distribution. The process involves calibrating building physics parameters to reflect passive cooling measures, leading to estimates of Theoretical Useful Energy Demand (TUED) and Practical Useful Energy Demand (PUED). Specifically, the following parameters are estimated: </p> <ul> <li>Theoretical Useful Energy Demand (TUED): This step models the potential cooling demand if all built floor area had space cooling technologies, serving as a baseline to assess energy savings from passive measures. This is taken as input from results generated by the Invert EE-lab model.</li> <li>Diffusion Rates of Technology: The adoption rates of active cooling technologies are analyzed to translate theoretical potential into practical application, reflecting realistic market penetration. The diffusion rates are used to scale the TUED to practical useful energy demand.</li> <li>Final Energy Demand: After considering the adoption of passive and active technologies, the actual energy consumption (Final Energy Demand) is estimated, accounting for different rates of technological advancement and the mix of technologies employed.</li> <li>Impact of Passive Measures: The methodology rigorously accounts for the potential energy savings achievable through various scenarios of passive measure uptake, allowing for detailed projections of energy demand reductions across different EU regions and timeframes.</li> <li>Economic Parameters: Based on the impact of the predefined scenarios of the active and passive measures, the module calculates costs for implementing such scenarios in terms of the cooling provided as well as the costs per unit of energy savings.

In the simplified approach presented here, we consider that these measures, when implemented, are taken together and make it possible to reduce the space cooling needs by up to 50%. </p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"cm-technologies-and-measures/#input","title":"Input","text":""},{"location":"cm-technologies-and-measures/#input-parameters","title":"Input parameters","text":"<p>The user shall define the following inputs (defauts value are also suggested): </p> <ul> <li>Building sector selection</li> <li>Space cooling diffusion rate</li> <li>Average Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) of SC technologies</li> <li>Measures uptake scenario.</li> </ul> <p>Building sector selection indicates the building sector selected in the current calculation.

These efforts directly contribute to the preparation of national comprehensive assessment reports.</p> <p>The Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) mandates that EU Member States conduct a Comprehensive Assessment to identify the most resource- and cost-efficient solutions for meeting heating and cooling demands. This assessment is crucial for promoting energy efficiency and integrating high-efficiency cogeneration and efficient district heating and cooling systems. The following sections outline how the capabilities of the CoolLIFE tool, combined with the resources available in the KnowledgeHub, can support member states in conducting comprehensive cooling analyses and developing strategic cooling plans. These efforts directly contribute to the preparation of national comprehensive assessment reports. Focusing on the cooling sector, the Comprehensive Assessment requires the following aspects to be covered:</p> <ul> <li>Data Collection: Map cooling demand and define system boundaries to accurately capture needs.</li> <li>Technical Potential: Assess the potential for efficient cooling, including district cooling and renewable sources.</li> <li>Scenarios: Develop a baseline (current demand) and alternative scenarios with efficient cooling measures.</li> <li>Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA): Conduct a cooling-focused CBA, including environmental and health benefits.</li> <li>Optimal Solutions: Identify the most cost-effective cooling strategies, prioritizing efficient and renewable options.</li> </ul> <p>The methodology/strategy used with the CoolLIFE toolbox allows a user to generate results that can be seen as first-level inputs to the Comprehensive Assessment report. This methodology can provide preliminary data and insights, supporting detailed assessments required by the EED and facilitating efficient planning of cooling strategies.</p> <p>The following figure shows the sequence of methodological steps for evaluating the cooling energy scenarios for the cooling energy demand.</p> <p></p> <p>To maintain user-friendliness, the toolbox minimizes user input requirements by offering a selection of pre-defined scenarios. This allows users to evaluate different combinations of active and passive measures for development.</p> <p>For the distribution of the building stock, in the predefined scearios,  the building physics parameters are first configured in order to simulate the passive measures. In this way, the potential energy savings can be estimated under different scenarios for the implementation of passive measures. This is done on the basis of the Invert/EE-Lab model [&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;]. This serves as the basis for calculating the theoretical cooling demand (useful energy demand). This represents the cooling demand if it is assumed that 100 % of the built-up areas that have a certain cooling demand are actually conditioned with active cooling. The technology penetration rates of active cooling are then included again as predefined scenarios, taking into account the speed and extent of the introduction of active cooling technologies. This step is crucial as it translates the theoretical cooling demand into a practical cooling demand that can actually be met. This metric reflects the realistic energy demand for space cooling after taking into account the market penetration of active cooling technologies and measures.</p> <p>In the subsequent phase of the assessment, the user can focus on the cooling energy demand (final energy demand), which indicates the actual energy consumption after the implementation of active cooling technologies. The user can select from a range of different rates of technological development and a mix of active technologies. In the course of this, it is assumed that technological progress leads to improved performance figures. For each of the resulting scenarios, electricity requirements and economic key figures are determined by the tool. This allows the user to compare, evaluate, and interpret these scenarios. </p> <p>Pre-defined scenario assumptions theoretical cooling requirement with region-specific values:</p> Parameter Region Baseline Moderate Efficiency (Manual Systems) High Efficiency (Radiation-Controlled Systems) Activation of sun protection systems (South) Category Mediterranean 0.66 0.67 0.88 Category Rest 0.66 0.67 0.79 Activation of sun protection systems (East-West) Category Mediterranean 0.39 0.54 0.81 Category Rest 0.24 0.36 0.7 Activation of sun protection systems (North) Category Mediterranean 0 0.03 0.43 Category Rest 0 0 0 Proportion of shading devices on window surfaces (South) Category Mediterranean 0.5 0.67 1 Category Rest 0.5 0.5 0.8 Proportion of shading devices on window surfaces (East-West) Category Mediterranean 0.33 0.39 0.5 Category Rest 0.33 0.33 0.5 Proportion of shading devices on window surfaces (North) Category Mediterranean 0 0.03 0.43 Category Rest 0 0 0 Reduction factor z for movable sun protection systems Category Mediterranean 0.7 0.62 0.24 Category Rest 1 0.8 0.24 g-value Category Mediterranean 0.75 0.52 0.25 Category Rest 0.65 0.35 0.25 Night ventilation (Air exchange rate during night ventilation) Category Mediterranean Baseline Baseline Baseline Category Rest Baseline Baseline * 1.5 Baseline * 2 Average indoor temperature of cooled building areas Category Mediterranean Baseline Baseline + 1 Baseline + 2 Category Rest Baseline Baseline + 2 Baseline + 4 <p>The pre-defined assumption for practical and useful energy demand and need:</p> Scenario Dimension Name Range of Scenario Design Market Penetration of Active Cooling High-Moderate-Low High Market Penetration: +10% by 2050 compared to \"moderate\"Moderate Market Penetration: 2% increase by 2050Low Market Penetration: No increase in market penetration compared to the base year Annual Utilization Rate of Active Cooling High-Moderate-Low High Annual Utilization Rate: Average annual performance factors increase by a value of 6 by 2050.Moderate Annual Utilization Rate: Average annual performance factors increase by a value of 3 by 2050.Low Annual Utilization Rate: No increase in annual performance factors compared to the base year <p>For each run of the calculation module, the user can generate results in terms of the following parameters:</p> <ul> <li>Parameters</li> <li>Total Final Energy demand from the scenario</li> <li>Useful Energy saving potential from the selected scenario in the year 2050</li> <li>Percentage Final Energy demand savings</li> <li>Description of the Scenario</li> <li>Charts</li> <li>Total Useful Energy demand of the scenario vs. Baseline for years 2030,2040 and 2050 </li> <li>Total Final Energy demand of the scenario vs. Baseline for years 2030,2040 and 2050</li> <li>Break down of total investment in active and passive measures (scenario vs. Baseline)</li> <li>Comparison of levelized cost of cooling (Passive - Euros per MWh of saved useful energy demand; Active - Euros per MWh of supplied useful energy demand) For specific details on running the calculation module check CM: Economic Feasibility</li> </ul> <p>The results for each run of the calculation module can be analyzed by the user, making it possible to compare different scenarios.</p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"use-case-7-comprehensive-assessment-report/#how-to-cite","title":"How To Cite","text":"<p>Aadit Malla, in CoolLIFE-Wiki, User Story 7: Provide inputs to the development of the National Comprehensive Assessment Report</p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"use-case-7-comprehensive-assessment-report/#authors-and-reviewers","title":"Authors And Reviewers","text":"<p>This page was written by Aadit Malla EEG-TU WIEN</p> <p>This page was reviewed by Ardak Akhatova e-think</p> <p>This page was reviewed by Simon Pezzuto EURAC Research</p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"use-case-7-comprehensive-assessment-report/#license","title":"License","text":"<p>Copyright \u00a9 2024-2025: Aadit Malla</p> <p>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</p> <p>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 International License.</p> <p>SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-4.0</p> <p>License-Text: https://spdx.org/licenses/CC-BY-4.0.html</p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"use-case-7-comprehensive-assessment-report/#acknowledgement","title":"Acknowledgement","text":"<p>We would like to convey our deepest appreciation to the LIFE Programme CoolLIFE Project (Grant Agreement number 101075405), which co-funded the present investigation.</p> <p>Go To Top</p>"},{"location":"user-interface-navigation/","title":"User Interface & Navigation","text":""},{"location":"user-interface-navigation/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This page provides instructions on how to access the CoolLIFE Tool and introduces its GIS-based interface.
